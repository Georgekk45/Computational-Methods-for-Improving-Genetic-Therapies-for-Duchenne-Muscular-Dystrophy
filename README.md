# Computational-Methods-for-Improving-Genetic-Therapies-for-Duchenne-Muscular-Dystrophy

My Master's thesis titled "Computational Methods for Improving Genetic Therapies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy," presents an in-depth study integrating genetic engineering, specifically prime editing techniques, with computational approaches like machine learning to address Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It delves into the biological background of DMD, detailing CRISPR gene editing methods, and explores the use of machine learning algorithms to optimize pegRNA design for gene therapy.
